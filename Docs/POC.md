# PortLink - Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview

PortLink is an innovative project designed to provide robust support for real-time video stream and data handling in a surveillance system. This project aims to deliver a highly secure and scalable system, utilizing cutting-edge technologies to support video streaming, data processing, and real-time communication. Initially conceived as a personal venture, PortLink is evolving into a comprehensive surveillance solution with potential applications across various industries.

## Code Stack

### Primary Languages

- C++ 20: The core of PortLink's system is built using C++20, chosen for its performance and fine-grained control over low-level memory operations.

- Python: Provides a backend interface for integrating advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) functionalities, planned for future system updates and enhancements.

### Key Technologies

- No External Libraries: Currently, the project minimizes dependencies by avoiding third-party libraries, promoting a lightweight and customizable architecture.

- Cross-Platform Support: The system natively supports both Windows and Linux. Platform-specific APIs are abstracted to create a unified and consistent framework that operates seamlessly across these environments.

## Architecture

### Real-Time Video Stream Handling

- PortLink is engineered for real-time video streaming, with the capacity to efficiently process and deliver video feeds. The architecture is optimized for low-latency transmission, ensuring minimal delay in live video delivery.

- Local Device Capture: PortLink currently captures real-time video and audio streams from locally connected webcams and microphones. A device manager will be implemented to discover and connect to these local peripherals.

- Future Wireless and Consumer Device Integration: Future development will focus on expanding device support to include wireless cameras, CCTV systems, and DVRs, broadening PortLink's applicability for mainstream surveillance solutions.

- Stream Encoding: Employs advanced encoding techniques to maximize bandwidth efficiency without compromising video and audio quality.

- Real-Time Video Processing: Handles the processing of live video feeds, including features like motion detection, object tracking, and scene analysis.

## Data Handling & Encryption
- PortLink prioritizes the secure transmission of sensitive data.

- End-to-End Encryption: All video streams and data are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

- Data Integrity: Implements robust data validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity of transmitted data.

- Secure Communication Channels: The system utilizes secure channels (e.g., TLS) for communication between components, mitigating potential security threats.

## Build System
### CMake

PortLink employs CMake 3.20 as its build system to streamline the compilation and packaging process across different platforms. CMake generates platform-specific projects (e.g., Visual Studio Solutions for Windows, Makefiles for Linux), enabling seamless compilation and testing in both environments.

- Modular Build Setup: The build system's modular design facilitates the integration of additional components and future system modifications.

- Scripts: Custom build scripts are provided to generate Visual Studio solutions or directly compile executables for both supported platforms.

- Cross-Platform Configuration: Platform-specific configurations for Windows and Linux are abstracted, simplifying the build process and enhancing adaptability.

## Future Enhancements

- Machine Learning & AI Integration (Python Backend): PortLink's design emphasizes extensibility. Future development will integrate Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities via a Python backend. Potential AI features include object detection, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics to enhance the system's functionality.

- Real-Time Event Monitoring & Alerts: Future versions of PortLink will incorporate real-time event monitoring, with the ability to send alerts based on specific triggers such as unauthorized movement, vehicle recognition, or personnel identification.

## Security Considerations

- End-to-End Encryption: All video streams and data are encrypted from capture to delivery, ensuring confidentiality.

- User Authentication: The system will implement multi-layered security to authenticate users and control access to video and data streams.

- Data Privacy: PortLink is designed with a focus on privacy. Access to video feeds and sensitive data is restricted to authorized users, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
